# Capitalization

Nordic Semiconductor style uses sentence-style capitalization.
That means everything is lowercase except the first word and proper nouns, which include the names of brands, products, and services.
(To help customers recognize, find, and buy products, reserve capitalization for product and service names.)

Follow these guidelines in Nordic content:

- Use sentence-style capitalization most of the time. That means:
    - Capitalize the first word of a sentence, heading, title, UI label (such as the name of a button or check box), or standalone phrase.
    - Capitalize proper nouns. To learn more about proper nouns, see [Nouns and pronouns](~/grammar/nouns-pronouns.md).
    - Use lowercase for everything else.
- Always capitalize the first word of a new sentence. Rewrite sentences that start with a word that's always lowercase.
- Don't use all uppercase for emphasis. (It's OK to use italic sparingly for emphasis.)
- Don't use all lowercase as a design choice. Although all uppercase is used occasionally as a design element, don't use it in text.
- Don't use internal capitalization (such as *AutoScale* or *e-Book*) unless it's part of a brand name.
- Don't capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it's a proper noun.
- When words are joined by a slash, capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized.
  **Examples**
  - Country/Region
  - Turn on the On/Off toggle.
- For information on capitalization in hyphenated compound words, see [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md).
- Capitalize the first letter of the first word in bulleted or numbered lists, figure callouts, and text in table cells, unless it begins with a command name or other literal computer terms that are not capitalized.
- Capitalize the first letter of the first word following a colon if it starts a complete sentence.
- Capitalize the first letter of the terms "Table", "Section", "Part", "Figure", "Example", "Appendix", "Step", "Version", "Chapter", and "Release" when they are followed by a number or letter.
- Capitalize the first letter of each term that identifies the name of a keyboard key, like Control-C, the F key, Ctrl+Shift+F1.
- Capitalize the second element of a hyphenated compound word in a title or heading unless the first element is a prefix.
- Follow the same capitalization rules as titles and section headings for the first letter of the first word of a title or heading, example captions, figure captions, table captions, and table column headings.

**What Not to Capitalize**
- Do not capitalize the word "page" in page number descriptions, the "x" in hexadecimal text, dimensions, or processor architectures like "x86" and "x64."
- Do not capitalize placeholders and user-supplied values unless they include proper nouns.
- Maintain the case sensitivity of command and function names and other software elements.

## Sentence-style capitalization in titles and headings

Use sentence-style capitalization in most titles and headings: capitalize the first word and lowercase the rest.
**Exceptions** Proper nouns, including brand, product, and service names, are always capitalized. If a title or heading includes a colon, capitalize the first word after it.

Titles of blog posts, documentation articles, and press releases use sentence-style capitalization.
**Examples**
- Watch your favorite HD movies, TV shows, and more
- 1 TB of cloud storage
- Choose the Office version that's right for you
- Available for Microsoft partners and commercial and public-sector customers
- Can a search engine predict the World Cup winner?
- Block party: Communities use Minecraft to create public spaces

## Title-style capitalization

Occasionally, title-style capitalization — capitalizing most words — is appropriate. For example, product and service names, the names of blogs, book and song titles, article titles in citations, white paper titles, and titles of people (*Vice President* or *Director of Marketing*) require title-style capitalization. In a tweet, it's OK to use title-style capitalization to highlight the name of a quoted article.

On the rare occasions when title-style capitalization is required, follow these guidelines:

- Always capitalize the first and last words.
  **Example**
  - A Home to Go Back To
- Don't capitalize *a, an,* or *the* unless it's the first word.
  **Examples**
  - Microsoft on the Issues
  - The Official Microsoft Blog
- Don't capitalize prepositions of four or fewer letters (such as *on, to, in, up, down, of,* and *for*) unless the preposition is the first or last word.
  **Examples**
  - How to Personalize Windows
  - To Personalize Windows
  - Ryse: Son of Rome
  - Achieving Excellence in the Classroom Through Technology
  - OneNote Class Notebooks for Teachers
  - The Teaching Tool You're Looking For
- Don't capitalize *and, but, or, nor, yet,* or *so* unless it's the first word or the last word.
  **Example**
  - Monitoring and Operating a Private or Hybrid Cloud
- Capitalize all other words, including nouns, verbs (including *is* and other forms of *be*), adverbs (including *very* and *too*), adjectives, and pronouns (including *this, that,* and *its*).
  **Examples**
  - Enterprise Agility Is Not an Oxymoron
  - This Is All There Is
  - Teaching Math Over and Over Again, in Less Time Than Before
- Capitalize the word after a hyphen if it would be capitalized without the hyphen or it's the last word.
  **Examples**
  - Self-Paced Training for Microsoft Visual Studio
  - Microsoft Management Console: Five Essential Snap-ins
  - Five Essential Snap-ins for Microsoft Management Console
  - Copy-and-Paste Support in Windows Apps
- Capitalize the first word of labels and terms that appear in UI and APIs unless they're always lowercase (for example, *fdisk*).
- In programming languages, follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms.
