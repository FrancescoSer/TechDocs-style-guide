# Capitalization

Use sentence-style capitalization in most titles and headings. This means capitalizing the first word only and using lowercase for the rest, except in the case of proper nouns such as brands, products, and services.

## Sentence-style capitalization

* Capitalize the first letter of the first word in a sentence, heading, title, UI label (such as the name of a button or check box), or standalone phrase.
* Capitalize proper nouns. To learn more about proper nouns, see [Nouns and pronouns](grammar/nouns-pronouns.md).
* Use lowercase for everything else.
* Always capitalize the first word of a new sentence. Avoid starting sentences with a word that is always lowercase.

### Exceptions

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Proper nouns, including brand, product, and service names, are always capitalized. If a title or heading includes a colon, capitalize the first word after it only if it is a proper noun. | Watch your favorite HD movies, TV shows, and more. <br /> 1 TB of cloud storage |
| Titles of blog posts, documentation articles, and press releases use sentence-style capitalization. | Block party: Communities use Minecraft to create public spaces  |

## Title-style capitalization

Title-style capitalization, where most words are capitalized, is occasionally appropriate for product and service names, the names of blogs, article titles in citations, white paper titles, and titles of people (such as *Vice President* or *Director of Marketing*).

On the rare occasions when title-style capitalization is required, follow these guidelines:

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Always capitalize the first and last words. | A Home to Go Back To |
| Do not capitalize *a, an,* or *the* unless it is the first word. | The Official Microsoft Blog |
| Do not capitalize prepositions of fewer than four letters (such as *on, to, in, up, down, of,* and *for*) unless the preposition is the first or last word. | How to Personalize Windows |
| Do not capitalize *and, but, or, nor, yet,* or *so* unless it is the first or last word. | Monitoring and Operating a Private or Hybrid Cloud |
| Capitalize all other words, including nouns, verbs (including *is* and other forms of *be*), adverbs (including *very* and *too*), adjectives, and pronouns (including *this, that,* and *its*). | A Home to Go Back To |
| Capitalize the word after a hyphen only if it would be capitalized without the hyphen or it is the last word in a heading. | Self-paced Training for Microsoft Visual Studio |
| Capitalize the first word of labels and terms that appear in UI and APIs unless they are always lowercase (for example, *fdisk*). |  |
| In programming languages, follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms. |  |

## Do not use unnecessary capitalization

Avoid using unnecessary capitalization in the following ways:

* Do not use all uppercase for emphasis.
* Do not use all lowercase as a design choice.
* Do not use internal capitalization (such as *AutoScale* or *e-Book*) unless it is part of a brand name.
* Do not capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it is a proper noun.

### Exceptions

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| When words are joined by a slash, capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized. | Country/region <br /> Turn on the On/off toggle. |
