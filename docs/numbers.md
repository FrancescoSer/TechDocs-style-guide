# Numbers

Be consistent in your use of numbers. When you write about numbers used in examples or UI, duplicate them exactly as they appear in the UI. In all other content, follow the guidelines below.

## Numerals vs. words

### Use a numeral

Use a numeral instead of a word in the following situations.

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| In body text, use numerals for 10 or greater, but spell out whole numbers from zero through nine. <br /> If space is limited in tables or UI, it is ok to use numerals for zero through nine. | 10 screen savers <br /> five databases <br /> zero probability <br /> 7,990,000 |
| If one item requires a numeral, use numerals for all the other items of that type. | One article has 16 pages, one has 7 pages, and the third has only 5 pages. |
| When two numbers that refer to different things must appear together, use a numeral for one and spell out the other. | fifteen 20-page articles |
| Measurements of distance, temperature, volume, size, weight, pixels, points, etc., always use numerals. Abbreviate units whenever possible. | 3 ft, 5 in <br /> 80x80 pixels <br /> 0.75 g <br /> 3 cm |
| A number the customer is directed to enter. | Enter *5*. |
| A round number of 1 million or more. | 7 million |
| Coordinates of tables or worksheets and numbered sections of documents. | row 3, column 4 <br /> Chapter 10 <br /> Step 1 |
| When citing industry specifications or protocol versions that use specific numbering. | Thread 1.3 <br /> Zigbee 3.0 <br /> USB 2.0 protocol |
| When talking about dimensions like tile sizes, screen resolutions, and paper sizes, use a lowercase "x" with no spaces between the numbers. | 4x4 tile <br /> 8.5"x11" paper <br /> 1280x1024 pixels |
| Percentages, no matter how small, use a numeral plus *percent*. Use *percentage* when you don't specify a quantity. | At least 50 percent of your system resources should be available.|
| When referencing monetary values, always use numerals and include the currency symbol. | $5,000 <br /> €10 |
| For mixed units or complex items in lists, keep the format consistent. | 10 kg, 5 cm, and 12 in |

### Use a word

Use a word instead of a numeral in the following situations.

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| For days, weeks, and other units of time, spell out zero through nine and use numerals for 10 or greater. | seven years <br /> 28 days <br /> 12 hrs |
| For time of day, include *AM* or *PM* after the numerical time. <br /> Include the time zone if you're discussing an event. <br /><br /> **Exception:** Don't use numerals for *12:00*. Use *noon* or *midnight* instead. | 10:45 AM <br /> 6:30 PM <br /> The meeting is at noon. <br /> The event starts at 5:00 PM CST. |
| Don't start a sentence with a numeral. Add a modifier before the number, or spell the number out if you can't rewrite the sentence. <br /> It is ok to start list items with numerals—use your judgment. | More than 10 apps are included. <br /> Eleven apps are included. |
| Ordinal numbers should always be spelled out in text. | the first row <br /> the twenty-first anniversary |
| When referring to approximations, use words instead of numerals. | about ten items <br /> nearly five hours |

## Commas in numbers

### Use commas

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Use commas in numbers that have four or more digits. | $1,024 <br />1,093 MB |
| When designating years, pixels, or baud, use commas only when the number has *five or more digits*. | 1920x1080 pixels <br /> 10,240x4320 pixels <br /> 9600 baud <br /> 14,400 baud |
| Use commas in financial numbers where appropriate. | $5,000,000 |

### Don't use commas
| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Don't use commas in page numbers, addresses, or after the decimal point in decimal fractions. | page 1091 <br /> 1.06377 units |
| Don't use commas in version numbers. | Version 2.145 |

## Numbers in dates

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Use a numeral to describe a date, not ordinal numbers such as *October twenty-eighth*. | June 1 <br /> October 28 |
| Always spell out the name of the month. The positions of the month and day vary by country. Specify the format for the audience: MM/DD/YYYY for U.S., DD/MM/YYYY for others. | June 12, 2017 |
| When referencing ranges of dates, use *to* rather than a dash. | June 1 to June 10 |

## Negative numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Form a negative number with an [*en dash*](punctuation/dashes-and-hyphens.md#en-dashes), not a hyphen, with no space between the en dash and the number. | –79 |
| For financial contexts, use parentheses to indicate negative values. | ($5,000) |

## Compound numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Hyphenate compound numbers when they are spelled out. | twenty-five fonts <br /> the twenty-first day |

## Technical specifications with numeric values

When numbers combine with units to describe hardware specifications, apply consistent formatting:

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Hyphenate numeric descriptors that precede what they modify. | 64-bit architecture <br /> 1.8-V supply rail <br /> 128-KB SRAM |
| Write without hyphens when the specification follows what it describes. | The architecture uses 64 bits. <br /> Supply voltage is 1.8 V. <br /> SRAM capacity: 128 KB. |
| For frequency specifications, maintain hyphenation when modifying. | 2.4-GHz transceiver <br /> 32-MHz crystal |
| Use hyphens with numeric ranges that modify nouns. | 1.7-V to 3.6-V operating range <br /> 10-bit to 12-bit converter |

## Fractions and decimals

### Positioning fractional components

When expressing fractional measurements, format depends on the precision required and space available:

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Place fractional values adjacent to whole numbers without punctuation. | 2¼ turns <br /> 5½ cycles |
| When the combined value describes a component, connect with a hyphen to the unit. | 1½-turn potentiometer <br /> 3¾-inch standoff |
| Use decimal notation for voltage, current, and resistance values. | 3.3 V <br /> 0.25 A <br /> 4.7 kΩ |
| Add a leading zero before decimal points for values under one. | 0.5 cm <br /> 0.33 duty cycle |

### Choosing between fractional and decimal formats

Select the format that matches your technical context:

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Match connector and component industry naming conventions. | 3.5-mm headphone jack <br /> 2.54-mm pin spacing |
| Use decimals for electrical characteristics and measurements. | 1.25-V reference <br /> 0.1-µF capacitor |
| Express angular measurements in decimal degrees. | 45.5° phase shift <br /> 90.25° rotation |
| Spell out fractional proportions in descriptive text. | approximately one-third capacity <br /> reduced by one-half |

### Symbol versus written form

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Use fraction symbols (½, ¼, ¾) for physical measurements and mechanical specifications. | ¼-wave antenna <br /> ¾-inch mounting hole |
| Write fractions as words when discussing conceptual portions. | The bootloader occupies roughly one-quarter of flash memory. |
| In constrained spaces like tables, prefer symbols over words. | ½ <br /> ⅛ <br /> ⅔ |
| Hyphenate spelled-out fractions that form compound terms. | two-thirds majority <br /> three-eighths wavelength |

### Plural forms with fractional quantities

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Use plural units even when the value is less than one. | 0.5 meters <br /> 0.75 inches <br /> 0.25 milliseconds |
| Financial decimals follow currency formatting rules. | $0.50 <br /> €0.75 |

## Ordinal numbers

### Use ordinal numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Always spell out ordinal numbers. | the first row <br /> the twenty-first anniversary |
| Do not use ordinal numbers for dates. | June 1 (not June 1st) |
| Use ordinal numbers for steps in a procedure. | Step one: Open the app. |

## Ranges of numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Use *from* and *through* to describe a range of numbers. <br /> **Exception:** Don't use *from* before a range indicated by an en dash. | from 9 through 17 |
| Use an en dash in a range of pages or numbers. | pages 112–120 |
| Use *to* in a range of times. | 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM |
| Repeat the unit for clarity in ranges involving units. | -40°C to 100°C |
| For number ranges without units, use a closed en dash with no spaces. | 5–10 files |
| When referencing temperature ranges, explicitly include plus or minus symbols. | -10°C to +20°C |

## Abbreviations of numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Spell out *thousand*, *million*, and *billion*, or use the entire number. | Fabrikam, Inc., employs more than 65,000 people.<br />Total cost to the enterprise: 300,000 hours and $30 million per year |
| Use abbreviations for large numbers when space is limited. | 5K, 10M, 3B |

In UI, avoid abbreviations unless space is too limited to spell out the number. If abbreviations must be used, follow these guidelines:
* Capitalize *K*, *M*, and *B*.
* Don't put a space between the number and the abbreviation.
* Use the decimal form of a number only if it will genuinely save space.

### Formatting time durations consistently

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Write out time durations in full text unless space constraints exist. | 3 hours, 15 minutes (preferred) <br /> 3h 15m (if space is limited) |
| For ranges of time durations, use *to* instead of a dash. | 2 hours to 3 hours |
