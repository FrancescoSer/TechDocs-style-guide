# Semicolons

A semicolon is a punctuation mark used mainly in a coordinating function between major sentence elements such as independent clauses of a compound sentence.

Avoid using semicolons. Simplify the sentence by breaking it into multiple sentences or a list.

## Use a semicolon

Use a semicolon in the following situations.

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **Between two independent clauses that aren't joined by a conjunction.** | Select **Options**; then select **Automatic backups** |
| **Between contrasting statements that aren't joined by a conjunction.** | What's considered powerful changes over time; today's advanced feature might be commonplace tomorrow |
| **With conjunctive adverbs connecting independent clauses**</br> Though acceptable, prefer splitting into separate sentences for clarity. | The device supports low-power mode; however, full functionality requires active mode. | The device supports low-power mode. However, full functionality requires active mode. |

## Rewrite complex semicolon lists

When semicolons separate multiple items within a sentence, convert to a bulleted list:

| Complex semicolon structure | Clearer list format |
